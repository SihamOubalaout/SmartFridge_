# üßä SmartFridge: Revolutionizing Food Management with IoT & AI

In response to the growing need to reduce food waste and improve stock management in households, traditional methods of food management have become insufficient. The integration of **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies, **machine learning**, and **mobile applications** offers an optimal solution for users to efficiently monitor and manage their refrigerators. These advanced technologies enhance resource usage, convenience, and efficiency in food management.

The **SmartFridge** project automates processes such as real-time stock tracking, food freshness monitoring, and grocery and notification management. By leveraging a combination of techniques, including **IoT sensors**, **machine learning algorithms**, and **mobile development**, this prototype offers:

- ü•∂ **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Out-of-Stock Notifications**
- üç≥ **Recipe Suggestions via Integrated Chatbot**

## üõ†Ô∏è The Prototype

<img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0c45da5-9d37-4992-8af0-2690219fe429' width="500" height="500" alt="SmartFridge Prototype" />

Our **IoT prototype** is equipped with multiple sensors to collect environmental data. We use a **DHT11 sensor** to measure temperature and humidity, along with a water level indicator to maintain optimal water levels. A solenoid valve is simulated using an LED, enabling remote control of irrigation.

### Data Flow:
- The **Arduino** reads data from sensors (humidity, temperature, gas, and weight) and sends it to the **Raspberry Pi** via a serial connection.
- The **Raspberry Pi** handles communication between the Arduino and Firebase, orchestrating sensor data flow and controlling actuators.
- Python scripts, using **Pyrebase** for Firebase interaction and **PySerial** for serial communication with the Arduino, manage data transmission.

## üìä Data Flow with Node-RED

![Data Flow with Node-RED](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264d6d75-eddc-44ef-a079-fe2e1c182284)

We use **Node-RED** to orchestrate the sensor data flow, making it easy to process and send data to Firebase in real-time. 

### Steps in Node-RED:
1. **Sensor Reading**: Nodes are configured to read data from Arduino-connected sensors.
2. **Data Processing**: Function nodes format and process the sensor data before transmission.
3. **Sending to Firebase**: Data is transferred to Firebase using HTTP or specific Firebase nodes.

## üß† Machine Learning Model

To predict food freshness, we use data on temperature, humidity, and gas levels collected inside the fridge. A supervised learning algorithm, **Random Forest**, is trained using sensor data as features and food freshness as the target. This model provides accurate, real-time predictions to help maintain food quality and reduce waste.

### Artificial Dataset Generation

Due to the lack of existing datasets with specific sensor data (CO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, NO‚ÇÇ, Methanol, Temperature, Humidity), we generated an artificial dataset to simulate realistic conditions for food freshness prediction.
